# Song Ghost Login Instructions for Skool Members

Use these exact steps so access is applied correctly.

## 1) Open the app
- Go to your Song Ghost login page.

## 2) Apply your community code first
- On the login screen, click `Have a community code?`
- Enter your code and click `Verify`
- Confirm you see: `Community Access Unlocked`

Do this before creating your account or signing in.

## 3) Create your account (first-time users)
- Click `Sign up`
- Enter your email
- Enter a password (minimum 8 characters)
- Optional: enter referral code
- Click `Create Account`

## 4) Sign in (existing users)
- Click `Sign in`
- Enter your email and password
- Click `Continue`

## 5) Optional social login
- You can sign in with `Apple`, `Discord`, `Facebook`, `Google`, or `Microsoft`
- If using social login for the first time, still verify your community code first on the same screen

## What members should see after successful code activation
- `Community Access Unlocked`
- Benefits: `100 monthly credits + 50% off all purchases`

## Troubleshooting
- `Invalid or expired code`: re-check spelling and ask admin for a fresh code.
- `Validation failed`: retry in 30 seconds and check internet connection.
- `Account already exists`: switch to `Sign in` instead of `Sign up`.
- Wrong email account with OAuth: sign out and re-run login with the correct provider account.

## Admin checklist (recommended)
- Share community code privately in Skool.
- Ask members to verify code before signup/signin.
- Ask members to use one consistent email for all logins.
