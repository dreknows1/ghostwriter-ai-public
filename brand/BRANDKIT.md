# Song Ghost Brand Kit

## Naming
- Product name: `Song Ghost`
- Domain/URL: `songghost.com` (lowercase in copy), `www.songghost.com` (technical contexts)
- Avoid: `Ghostwriter AI`, `Ghostwriter A.I.`, `Songghost`, `SongGhost` (unless you intentionally standardize camel-case everywhere)

## Positioning
Song Ghost is a creative companion that helps artists finish songs fast while keeping their voice.

**One-line promise (recommended):**
`Finish lyrics, hooks, and cover art in minutes. Keep your voice.`

## Voice & Tone
- Confident, calm, direct.
- Outcome-first language (ship songs) over capability language (AI features).
- Avoid “AI hype” phrasing like “revolutionary”, “viral guaranteed”, “best ever”.

## Core Messages
Use consistently across Landing, Pricing, and Login.

- Headline: `Write. Refine. Release.`
- Subhead: `Song Ghost helps you draft lyrics, polish structure, and generate cover art in a cohesive style.`
- Proof points (pick up to 3):
  - `Genre-aware prompts and structure`
  - `Credits that map to real compute`
  - `Library + export-ready outputs`

## Visual System

### Logo Usage (logo stays the same)
The current mark is detailed and becomes illegible at small sizes. Use lockups, not resizing.

- `Hero mark`: full logo (safe above ~160px).
- `App header mark`: logo inside a 44–56px container with generous padding and a subtle outline.
- `Favicon`: use a simplified ghost silhouette version (same logo identity, simplified for legibility).

**Do:**
- Place on dark/neutral backgrounds.
- Add a subtle outer stroke/glow when used over gradients.

**Don’t:**
- Render the full detailed mark at 16–48px.
- Place directly on busy imagery without a container.

### Typography
Two-family system: one display face, one UI face.

- Display (headlines): `Unbounded`
- UI (body + controls): `Manrope`

Use the display font sparingly: hero headers, key section titles, pricing plan names.

### Color Tokens
Tokens live in `app/theme.css`.

- Background: deep navy, subtle radial color fields.
- Accent: icy cyan + mint (matches the logo’s cool highlights).
- Danger/Success: standard but muted (avoid neon red/green).

### Spacing & Shape
- Corner radius: large and consistent (12–32px depending on component).
- Panels: glass with strong blur and clear border lines.
- Shadows: deep, soft; avoid harsh drop shadows.

## UI Copy Guidelines
- Use `Song Ghost` in sentences: “Song Ghost is listening…”
- Use “credits” as a billing unit, but translate to actions (“Generate song”, “Generate cover art”).
- Always tell users what happens next (“Redirecting to Google…”, “Credits will update after confirmation.”).
